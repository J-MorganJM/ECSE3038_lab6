# IOT LAB 7
This exercise uses a circuit based on the ESP32 that continuously sends POST requests in the form of a JSON to a server to be able to store the data read from the device in the conneceted database.

The api is responsible for handling the post request from the ESP32 development board, in the form of  a JSON

The embedded program will read the value from the sensor and send the post request to the server.
